Procedures for post-processing of ensemble WRF TC simulations.

1. Regrid and merge via NCL: for selection of variables, regrids from staggered model grid and merges time steps into a single file.
 - batch_ncl.sh (submits multiple variables on compute nodes)
 - process_wrf.ncl (processes individual variables)
 - util.ncl (miscellaneous functions)

2. TC tracks: calculate TC track(s) for each ensemble member.
(Fast; doing this manually for now)
 - run_enstc_track.pro
 - tc_track.pro

3. Generate azimuthal files: use IDL routines to convert variable files following above step onto TC-following cylindrical coordinates.
(Slow; doing this in batch)
 - batch_azim.sh
 - idl_run_azim.pro
 - run_enstc_calc_azim.pro
 - wrf_regrid_azim.pro
