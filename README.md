# Ensemble Tropical Cyclone Cases

Repository containing key model start code, model namelists, and post-processing code for a numerical modeling study involving ensemble WRF simulations of tropical cyclones Haiyan (2013) and Maria (2017).

Uses the WRFv4.5 model (https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) for simulations and the NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS; https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-ensemble-forecast) data set as forcing data.
